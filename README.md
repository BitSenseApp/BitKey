This app is a work in progress and I made it as a project to learn more about Bitcoin and becasue all the other apps are too complicated and don't keep the principles of Bitcoin at heart.

With this app you can send transactions by scanning or inputting the addresses, then you can go into airplane mode to scan your private key to sign the transaction. WE NEVER SAVE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS as you can see in the code.

If the app has helped you and you'd like to donate some BTC please feel free at:

## Getting Started

Just download the app on the app store for the current version or build it in Xcode for the latest iteration which is here in GitHub, I use this mainly as a back up for myself and so the app keeps to Bitcoins open sourced principles.
