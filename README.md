# BitSense

A simple and reliable app that allows you to send Bitcoin payments (your private key never has to touch the internet), create secure Private Keys and Addresses for cold storage use. A bitaddress.org inspired app for your iPhone. I maximize offline functionality, never require a log in, or any data from you, no servers involved. Sign transactions locally in airplane mode. Check balances, transaction IDs and save addresses. Get the price of BTC in muliple currencies and the Mayer Multiple. Privacy first. Your keys your responsibility. You decide how to save them. Allows the user to roll dice to create Private Keys in order to create the most secure keys possible, simply input the dice rolls manually into the app and the dice rolls are then converted into bits until we have a 256 bit number.

This app is a work in progress and I made it as a project to learn more about Bitcoin and becasue all the other apps are too complicated and don't keep the principles of Bitcoin at heart.

With this app you can send transactions by scanning or inputting the addresses, then you can go into airplane mode to scan your private key to sign the transaction. WE NEVER SAVE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS as you can see in the code.

## Getting Started

Just download the app on the app store for the current version or build it in Xcode for the latest iteration which is here in GitHub, I use this mainly as a back up for myself and so the app keeps to Bitcoins open sourced principles.
